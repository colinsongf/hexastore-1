TODO:

[optimizer]

Implement query plan optimizer (based on which indexes are available, pushing down projection/filters). Start with a dynamic programming optimizer, then extend to IDP-balanced-bestRow (IDP1 will give monotonicity, but is slower than IDP2).

All optimizer code should take a world object that can contain the default tuning parameters. These can include: how much memory to use for IDP, what cost function to use to evaluate joins and subplans.

[hashjoin]

Implement hash join (with support for left-joins).

[storage]

Refactor hexastore storage layer (look at librdf's storage api), and then add a persistent, tokyocabinet-based store.

[sortedby]

Revamp the sorted_by code for variablebindings iterators. Right now there's the hx_variablebindings_iter_is_sorted_by_index function, but this needs to be extended to returning an array of expressions (with flag for ascending/descending), so we can tell that a variablebindings iterator is sorted by, e.g., "ASC(?s), DESC(STR(?p))".











Notes:

[2009.08.21]

5M triples can be loaded in 4GB of RAM, tested on ccni opterons. look to load <1MT/GB of memory (maybe closer to 1/2 = 625kT/GB) to leave room for intermediate results.
